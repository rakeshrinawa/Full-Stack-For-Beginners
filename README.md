HELLO EVERYONE!
Welcome to the first page of my project where you will find to start and learn everything on how to start your journey of amazing world of Web Development where you will be able to make and see the basics of Web Development in action.
These guides can also be used as a reference to help you build your own projects.
------------- Prerequisites ----------
Before you begin exploring the learning of codes which gives rise to the amazing Appearance, Logics and how sites talk to other sites to bring you anything at the tip of your hands, I recommend you take a quick overview of how this amazing world has developed itself into what it's now and where the future of Internet is going.
The Recommended links.
1. Fundamentals of Computer Science.
2. How programming languages work?
3. How Internet works?
4. How DNS, Routing, TCP, HTTP,IP and other Internet protocols work?
5. How 


In order to simulate real websites and build projects, you need to download some additional softwares which makes it easy, which are :-
1. A Browser to display your webpages. I would Google chrome as it's most updated. Don't use edge as it's outdated.
2. Git to clone your code and push your code to Github so that others can benefit from your efforts.
3. Code editor to edit and format your code to make writing and setting up Development environment easy. I would Visual Studio Code editor by Microsoft and it's both easy to use and comes with many extensions that makes it easy to write code with less eforts  and help in debugging.
