HELLO EVERYONE!
Welcome to the first page of my project where you will find to start and learn everything on how to start your journey of amazing world of Web Development where you will be able to make and see the basics of Web Development in action.
These guides can also be used as a reference to help you build your own projects.
------------- Prerequisites ----------
Before you begin exploring the learning of codes which gives rise to the amazing Appearance, Logics and how sites talk to other sites to bring you anything at the tip of your hands, I recommend you take a quick overview of how this amazing world has developed itself into what it's now and where the future of Internet is going.
The Recommended links.
1. Fundamentals of Computer Science.
2. How programming languages work?
3. How Internet works?
4. How DNS, Routing, TCP, HTTP,IP and other Internet protocols work?
5. How 


In order to simulate real websites and build projects, you need to download some additional softwares which makes it easy, which are :-
1. A Browser to display your webpages. I would Google chrome as it's most updated. Don't use edge as it's outdated.
2. Git to clone your code and push your code to Github so that others can benefit from your efforts.
3. Code editor to edit and format your code to make writing and setting up Development environment easy. I would Visual Studio Code editor by Microsoft and it's both easy to use and comes with many extensions that makes it easy to write code with less eforts  and help in debugging.

--------------- WHAT NOW  ----------------
I am just excited to Introduce you to this project.
So, let's get Started.
--------------------How to clone this repository in order to get started as you could-------------
1.To clone or Download -> Click icon next to the URL and copy the URL
2. Make a new folder, open it in terminal and paste this command -> $ git clone https://github.com/rakeshrinawa/Full-Stack-For-Beginners.git
and start playing around with the code as I explain below.
 ----------------How to Start your own project ----------
 Here I will show how I have done all this stuff so that Beginners can learn by building all this stuff. It's my honour to teach you.
1. Go to www.github.com and signup using any of the methods, it doesn't matter.
2. Login to your account and create a new repository from + button on the top right corner. Fill the details and Enter.
3. Go to settings of the page and enable Github Pages and a theme.
4. Clone the project in your computer locally so that you can develop whole of the project locally.
   $ git clone https://github.com/rakeshrinawa/Full-Stack-For-Beginners.git
5. configure git globally by entering your username, email and password.
6. Open the project in terminal and initialize git in it so that git software can be used to push your project to Github.com
    -> $ git init
7. Make a .gitignore file which will contain sensitive information like your login credentials and other files which shouldn't be pushed to       
   github.com 
 
 Now you are ready to build your first project.

 Open project in VS Code by right-click

------------------ How to develop your project ------------
Every project needs 3 things to work
1. Hardware -  Here it must be a Desktop Computer and not your mobile or tab.
2. Software - It is an application running on an OS which can understand your code and render it as desired. I am using Linux Ubuntu as OS for this and Live-server to render my code on a Browser. Kindly download the live-server extension in the VS code editor. Don't use Windows as it's not designed for  development purposes and most of its commands will be difficult..
3. The Lines of Code itself which should be fed to the Software/application.
